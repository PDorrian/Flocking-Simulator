# Flocking Simulation
This is a visualisation of a flocking behaviour commonly seen in animals such as birds and fish.<br/>
Each "boid" is given 3 simple rules:<br/>
1. Align: Move in the same directions as your neighbours.
2. Cohere: Stay close to your neighbours.
3. Separate: Do not collide with your neighbours.
Through a few simple rules, seemingly complex behaviour can emerge.<br/>
<br/>
This application models behaviour as outline by Craig Reynolds in his [1986 Paper](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~dt/siggraph97-course/cwr87/).
